## Requirements
Portfolio+ premium theme by Devin Price

Author supplied child theme for premium theme customization.

## Customization
Just a few customizations I did to a premium theme to personalize it for a client.
I extended the theme by writing custom code for additional template pages and custom fields for additional content and help text.

Custom features:

   * A landing page template with a post area and custom gallery linking to painting categories
   * Custom field descriptions for the paintings
   * Custom help instructions to make the posting process clear for the client

## Installation 

1. Upload the base parent theme`Portfolio+` to the `/wp-content/theme/` directory
1. Upload `Portfolio+ Child` to the `/wp-content/theme/` directory
1. Activate the child theme through 'Appearance' theme's in the WordPress admin.
